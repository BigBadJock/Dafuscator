Using Scutex you can create trial versions of your software products and allow your users to buy and use license keys or keyfiles to unlock your product. You can also have edition based licensing to unlock only select features based on the level of the license. Scutex supports upgrade licenses as well as allowing your customers who have an existing version of your product to upgrade to a new version.
